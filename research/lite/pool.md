## timer-refire-outcome-quantile

- kind: add | category: scheduler | origin: user | status: closed (2026-08-31, refuted net of A/A drift control)
- title: Cross-run learned refire budget: damp a timer class past the firing
  count that completed runs exhibit
- description: Session-global per-timer-class (resume vertex) firing-count
  histogram split by run outcome (Completed vs IterationsExhausted), merged
  at run end from TimerRunStats, decayed like GlobalTimeline. Derives a
  per-class refire budget (~p90 of completed-run firing counts,
  Laplace-smoothed, min 200 firings before deviating). In score_runnable a
  Runnable::Timer whose within-run count for that node passed its budget is
  score-multiplied by 0.25 (bounded, never zero). No config field. Counters:
  timer_refire_budget.damped / .classes_learned / .over_budget_firings.
- frozen prediction (admitted 2026-08-30): firingCounter
  timer_refire_budget.damped, floor 50000; rung depth>=6; sizePct 0.04-0.15;
  falsifier: damped >= 50000 yet depth>=6/s ratio < 1.03 at the sequential
  cap, or h2 drops > 2% relative. Independent observable:
  termination.all.iterations_exhausted share falls >= 3pp from ~72%, and
  timer_effects.inert_streak.long.fired per run falls >= 25% while
  timer_effects.all.acted per run stays within 5%.
- judge: expectedGain 6, expectedCost 0. All citations verified. Red team:
  count-conditioning may reduce to the falsified phase-of-budget gating;
  outcome labels are length-confounded (exhausted runs fire more of every
  class); score damping cannot shorten exhausted runs (no stall exit merged),
  so the runs/s story depends entirely on completion conversion.

## timer-class-completion-credit

- kind: add | category: feedback | origin: user | status: proposed
- title: Per-class completion-odds credit reweighting within the timer queue
- description: Session-global per-class (completed, exhausted) firing weights
  from TimerRunStats + RunOutcome, decayed; bounded multiplier [0.5, 2.0] =
  smoothed odds ratio vs session average, identity until 200 firings, applied
  in score_runnable. Two-sided (promotes and demotes). No config field.
  Counters: timer_outcome_credit.reweighted / .up / .down / .classes.
- frozen prediction (rewritten by judge before admission, per rubric): rung
  depth>=6, sizePct 0.02-0.10, firingCounter timer_outcome_credit.reweighted,
  floor 50000. Independent observable REWRITTEN: timer_steer.raised/lowered
  admission split shifts >= 5% relative and .up and .down each exceed 10% of
  .reweighted (the original timer_effects.by_key table is not in the exported
  eval record). Falsifier: reweighted >= 50000 with .up and .down nonzero,
  yet depth>=6/s ratio < 1.02 AND plan_complete share moves < 1pp.
- judge: expectedGain 4, expectedCost 0. Rides the same learning mechanism as
  timer-refire-outcome-quantile (dedupe: only one ranks high). Value: cheapest
  premise test for the family; a null discounts the siblings' learning half.

## timer-send-debt-brake

- kind: add | category: scheduler | origin: user | status: proposed
- title: Within-run message-debt brake: deprioritize a timer whose previous
  firings' sends are still undelivered
- description: Tag records enqueued in timer-woken segments with the waking
  timer's resume vertex; per-(node, vertex) debt = such records still
  undelivered; Runnable::Timer with debt d scores * max(0.25, 1/(1+d)).
  Counters: timer_debt.evaluated / .damped / .peak.
- frozen prediction: rung depth>=6, sizePct 0.03-0.12, firingCounter
  timer_debt.damped, floor 50000. Independent observable (2nd clause
  rewritten by judge): deliveryEffects deliveries per run falls >= 8% with
  acted_fraction rising, and termination.all.pending_work_at_exit_sum per
  completing run falls >= 15% from baseline ~29.6 (the cited ~9k backlog
  figure was unsupported). Falsifier: damped >= 50000 yet depth>=6/s < 1.03,
  or deliveries per run unchanged, or h2 regresses > 2% relative.
- judge: expectedGain 4, expectedCost 2 (hooks the record lifecycle — event
  accounting surface; a missed decrement path silently biases). Red team:
  against a never-draining frontier debt is almost always positive, so the
  brake likely collapses to the falsified uniform timer down-weight.

## learned-run-cap-probe-p99

- kind: add | category: scheduler | origin: user | status: merged (3bb90a1, 2026-08-31; prediction band missed low, see observations)
- title: Session-learned primary run cap at p99 x 1.5 of probe-completed
  lengths; config max_iterations demoted to backup terminator
- description: New run_cap.rs session-global learner keyed by post-arm-overlay
  max_iterations (backup budget). run_id % 32 == 0 runs are probes: always run
  to backup, sole feeders of the learner. Non-probe effective cap =
  min(backup, ceil(1.5 * p99 of scope's completed-probe lengths)), identity
  until 200 completed probe samples per scope. New termination class
  (RunEnd/RunOutcome LearnedCapReached, termination.all.learned_cap_reached).
  Learner exports run_cap.probes / .probe_completions / .over_cap_completions
  (would-have-been-killed completions - absorbs variant 3's safety
  measurement) / .scopes_learned / .current_cap_max_scope (diagnostic). Zero
  config fields; constants PROBE_PERIOD=32, QUANTILE=0.99, HEADROOM=1.5,
  MIN_COMPLETED_SAMPLES=200. Plan:
  research/lite/plans/learned-run-cap-probe-p99.md
- frozen prediction (freezes at user approval): firingCounter
  termination.all.learned_cap_reached, floor 1000; rung depth>=6
  events/explore-second; sizePct +0.30 to +1.20. Falsifier: per-run
  P(depth>=6) falls > 5% below same-seed baseline in any capped arm after an
  A/A drift control; or rate gain < +30% with the cap engaged; or
  learned_cap_reached stays 0 while the 6000 scope has >= 200 completed
  probe samples. Independent observables: iterations_exhausted share in
  6000-backup scopes collapses toward the ~1/32 probe share;
  run_cap.probes ~ runs/32; over_cap_completions reported (large values are
  the conservatism warning). Judge rewrite applied: "cap settles below 4000"
  demoted to reported diagnostic.
- judge: expectedGain 7, expectedCost 0. All citations and code anchors
  verified; effect arithmetic redone (gain +122% if cap lands ~1500, ~+45%
  at ~3200, ~+15% at ~4700; realized point hangs on unmeasured p99). Risks:
  depth preservation at short caps approximate (grid-short -3.1% pooled vs
  the 5% clause with ~2.5% chunk noise); gain is throughput-shaped
  (legitimate: violations are per-run events, so runs/s at flat per-run
  probability is violations/s).

## learned-run-cap-max-observed

- kind: add | category: scheduler | origin: user | status: closed (dominated: parent merged with per-run depth preserved; headroom question answered)
- title: Conservatism contrast: primary cap at running max of
  probe-completed lengths
- Held unbuilt per judge familyAdvice: activate only if
  learned-run-cap-probe-p99 trips its depth-preservation falsifier (then
  max-observed is the conservative frontier to price); close as dominated if
  the parent passes. expectedGain 4, expectedCost 0. Prediction as proposed
  (+8-30% d>=6/s, floor 100 on termination.learned_cap_reached) with judge
  rewrite pending if activated: "plan_complete unchanged" must exclude the
  pre-convergence warmup window.

## learned-cap-progress-conditioned

- kind: add | category: scheduler | origin: user | status: rejected-by-judge
- title: Progress-conditioned learned cap (terminate only quiescent runs
  past the learned length)
- Rejected on a checkable false claim: baseline prefix_extension counters
  show 100% of exhausted runs are budget_releasing, tail_without_release_sum
  22043/347880 runs (~0.06 steps/run) - the arming condition (release-free
  stretch >= max(cap/8, 64)) essentially never passes under the current
  purgatory dose; the proposal conflated no-history-growth quiescence with
  the release census. Its safety-measurement goal is folded into the
  parent's run_cap.over_cap_completions export.

## timer-admission-context-odds-probe

- kind: add | category: scheduler | origin: user | status: MERGED 2026-08-31
  (superproject ed21963, spur 249189d; d>=6/s pooled 1.190, per-run +30%)
- title: Steer effective p_timer at queue selection by learned
  per-context-cell timer acted odds
- Moderated lane, third user idea. Probe runs (run_id % 32 == 16, disjoint
  from run_cap's phase 0) learn per-cell timer acted rates from the existing
  per-firing state-token probe; steered runs multiply p_timer at the
  Probabilistic roll by clamp(cell_rate/global_rate, 0.25, 4.0), 200-firing
  floor per cell, 48 structural cells (pending-deliveries x in-flight x
  node-max inert streak x restart recency). No config field. Judge: gain 6,
  cost 0 - every checkable claim verified; baseline shows 2.5-60x acted-rate
  separation on two of four cell axes; but ~92% of firings are at
  uncontested steps, so the lever is promotion-only over ~8% of firing mass
  (band trimmed to +2..6% accordingly). Plan (with the judge's four
  admission conditions): research/lite/plans/timer-admission-context-odds-probe.md.
  Prediction freezes at user approval.

## timer-admission-two-arm-acted-contrast

- kind: add | category: scheduler | origin: user | status: not-admitted
  (judge gain 3, cost 0)
- title: Two-arm probe contrast - timer vs displaced delivery, per
  structural context
- Same lever and cells as timer-admission-context-odds-probe. Judge
  arithmetic kills it as written: global timer odds 0.138 vs delivery odds
  0.650 puts the unnormalized odds ratio (~0.21) below the 0.25 clamp floor,
  so nearly every cell saturates at x0.25 - the refuted uniform down-weight
  with extra machinery; delivery-draw cell attribution is also unspecified
  (counterfactual timer unidentified at delivery wins). Its stated
  starvation risk is empty (~555k timer-arm samples/chunk). Revisit only if
  the parent merges AND per-cell probe rates suggest delivery-conditioned
  contrast adds information - then with global-odds normalization and an
  attribution rule.

## timer-steer-coverage-holdout-governor

- kind: add | category: scheduler | origin: user | status: rejected-by-judge
  (gain 1)
- title: Context-odds timer bias governed by a randomized coverage holdout
- Governor statistic is degenerate under the current config:
  general_vr.json sets novelty_enabled false, and the baseline shows all
  347,880 runs novelty-ablated with 5 cumulative distinct timeline keys -
  novel-keys-per-run compares ~0 vs ~0, so the governor never governs. The
  holdout idea itself is already present in the parent (phase-16 probes).
  Revisit only if a novelty-enabled config lands via its own re-baselined
  iteration.

## run-cap-trajectory-variance-fix

- kind: change | category: scheduler | origin: operator-agent | status: MERGED 2026-08-31
  (c61d303, spur 46b9c5c; A/A 1.004-1.007 vs 1.10-1.14 disease; one proxy
  clause fired once, recorded;
  judge gain 7, cost 0 - ranked first over the four fault-timing proposals;
  plan research/lite/plans/run-cap-trajectory-variance-fix.md, amended at
  the hold per user objection to freeze-forever under future long
  non-stationary sessions - shape is now deterministic doubling-checkpoint
  recompute at completed counts 200, 400, 800, ...; constant between
  checkpoints, adaptive forever, zero new constants)
- title: Shrink the learned run cap's session-to-session trajectory variance
- Motivating fact (2026-08-31 A/A control): identical binary/config/seed drew
  cap 4283 vs 5975; cap trajectory alone moves runs/s and every per-second
  rung ~14% at chunk scale, so the grader's per-second null bands understate
  the true null. Candidate shapes (one per iteration, not together): freeze
  the cap after N probe completions instead of tracking a racing quantile;
  widen the probe stream or the histogram's sample floor so the p99 estimate
  stabilizes before the cap engages; or blend toward a longer-horizon
  quantile. Prediction to freeze at admission: A/A base-vs-base throughput
  ratio inside ~1.03 (vs today's 1.14) with the merged tree's depth
  rates preserved. Doubles as the quantile/headroom dose-contrast vehicle.

## crash-placement-completion-span-draw

- kind: add | category: scheduler | origin: proposer | status: MERGED 2026-09-01
  (cfdcdf6, spur 032ea69; d>=6/s 2.39, posture contrast 2.157x, panel
  paxos per-run violations +35%; band missed high)
- title: Crash placement drawn uniformly over the completed-run span instead
  of geometrically at readiness
- Crash timing is the census-named open axis (baseline: 3.70M crash-eligible
  steps vs 722.6k crashes taken - placement is geometric within ~5 eligible
  steps of readiness); actuator is the eligibility mask, which the census
  shows has authority. Posture split ((run_id >> 5) & 1): half of runs stay
  exactly stock, giving an internal placed-vs-stock contrast immune to
  residual measurement noise.
- FROZEN PREDICTION (admission rewrite applied 2026-09-01, judge conditions
  a-d folded in): rung depth>=6, sizePct +5..25% per second; firingCounter
  crash_place.holds, floor 50000 per chunk; diagnostics crash_place.draws,
  crash_place.capped_draws, crash_place.held_steps_sum exported beside it.
  Mechanism bounds per the rewrites: draw t ~ U[t_ready, min(L50,
  3*effective_cap/4)) - the quarter reserve is the recovery-tail margin;
  L50 learned only from stock-posture uncapped probes (run_id % 64 == 0)
  in a fault_timing.rs scope table with doubling-checkpoint recomputes
  (the run_cap pattern), 200-sample floor. Falsifier: with holds >= 50000
  per chunk, refuted if placed-posture pooled per-run P(depth>=6) <=
  stock-posture pooled per-run P(depth>=6) on the candidate side (primary,
  same seeds), or if candidate/baseline pooled per-run P(depth>=6) < 1.05
  net of a same-session A/A control; closed without a rate read if holds
  < 50000 or the L50 table never reaches its floor. Independent
  observables: held_steps_sum/holds >> 0 (crashes displaced right); placed
  runs' plan_complete share falls while stock runs' share is unchanged;
  cap gauge read on both sides each chunk (placed-posture probes lengthen,
  raising later checkpoints - a watched coupling, not a falsifier).

## recovery-drain-point-sampler

- kind: add | category: scheduler | origin: proposer | status: proposed
  (judge gain 5, cost 0; queued behind crash-placement's result)
- title: Recovery admission stratified uniformly over the victim's own
  in-flight send drain
- Snapshot k = victim's in_flight at crash, draw d ~ U{0..k}, withhold
  Recover via is_ineligible until in_flight <= d; d=k is stock, k=0 (59% of
  crashes) never held. senderRestarted-falls binding proof verified
  mechanically (incarnation bumps at recovery; 443k stale-sender deliveries
  per chunk, 19.0% acted vs 2.1% receiver-restarted). Judge caveats: drain
  is NOT monotone (a crashed receiver recovering re-enters the victim's
  message into flight); site carries seven closures plus a placebo warning;
  no internal control as drafted. Rewrites required: d=k runs as the
  randomized same-side null (primary clause), hold bound ~400 steps against
  the purgatory pin, A/A-netted bar.

## cascade-fault-window-admission

- kind: add | category: scheduler | origin: proposer | status: rejected-by-judge (gain 2)
- title: Later crashes held to land inside another node's crash or
  fresh-restart window
- Steers toward a recorded zero-violation stratum: overlapping crash windows
  0/91 violations vs 23.6% for disjoint (OBSERVATIONS.md:841-846) on a
  100%-3-node config where two down is quorum loss; and the hold has no
  reopening path once the first freshness window closes (the valve never
  fires on this rig), so late second crashes are held to run end. A
  fresh-window-only bounded-hold respecification may re-enter, but must
  answer OBSERVATIONS.md:841-869.

## crash-context-admission-odds-probe

- kind: add | category: scheduler | origin: proposer | status: parked
  (judge gain 4, cost 0)
- title: Learned per-context crash-admission odds replacing the fixed
  partial-fanout coin, probe-contrast
- Identity point verified (r=1 reproduces the 0.5 coin exactly); phase 8
  disjoint from 0/16; label plumbing feasible without touching accounting.
  Parked because the run-end label class (post-recovery window outcome) is
  the shape refuted in timer-refire-outcome-quantile and the dose (a coin
  moving crashes ~5 eligible steps) is the weakest of the round. Revisit
  only after crash-placement/recovery-drain shows the timing axis moves
  depth, and then with a decision-adjacent secondary label.

## client-request-placement-span-draw

- kind: add | category: scheduler | origin: proposer | status:
  awaiting-approval (judge gain 8, cost 2, net 6) | parent:
  crash-placement-completion-span-draw | plan:
  research/lite/plans/client-request-placement-span-draw.md
- title: Client requests get the admission placement crashes already have -
  hold a released request until later in the run's own activity instead of
  invoking it the step it becomes ready
- Every checkable claim held. There is genuinely no admission control on
  client-op invocation anywhere in the simulator: crashes carry a Runnable
  priority plus an eligibility mask and `crash_hold_until`, while client
  requests are dispatched inline at `path.rs:458` in the step they become
  ready. The dead `PlanEngine::mark_as_ready` (`path/plan.rs:126-137`,
  `#[allow(dead_code)]`) has exactly the InProgress -> Ready signature the
  hold needs, because `get_ready_events` performs the forward transition
  itself. Reuses the actuator shape of this session's largest win on a
  per-run population four times larger (~9 client events against 2 crashes),
  with a band derived independently rather than borrowed.
- Cost 2 is real: deferring invocation moves when invocation records reach
  the history (the linearizability recording path) and reorders the
  deadlock/termination test in the run loop.
- Judge rewrote the prediction to add the run-length confound the original
  omitted: steps/run and plan_complete share must be reported per posture,
  and depth bought by lengthening runs (placed steps/run outside 15% of
  stock) is not a pass.
- Standing red-team note to answer in review: the nearest recorded evidence
  is the post_fault_client_ops family, closed permanently at
  `OBSERVATIONS.md:3052` by a zero ablation. That null is about plan
  ORDERING; this candidate is about INVOCATION TIMING, which no log entry
  touches. The distinction is the hypothesis's load-bearing claim.

## post-fault-supply-census

- kind: add | category: tooling | origin: proposer | status: parked behind
  client-request-placement-span-draw (judge gain 5, cost 0)
- title: Per-run census of client work and in-flight traffic surviving the
  run's last fault cycle, tagged so the grader reads its depth contrast
- Read-only diagnostic; counters and the free variant bit 1<<4 verified.
  One claim FAILED: `State::flight_enter`/`flight_leave` do not track
  crash-relative in-flight traffic - `SendLedger` holds a per-origin current
  count whose floor resets at every handler entry (`state.rs:978-981`), so
  the census's headline quantity needs new per-runnable bookkeeping it
  budgets nothing for.
- Also correlational by construction: the bit is an outcome, not an
  assignment, and conditions on something mechanically tied to run length -
  the same composition confound that made runCapProbe read 1.068 before the
  alias fix. Run it only if the placement candidate comes back null, when
  knowing whether late client work is scarce or merely mis-ordered becomes
  the deciding measurement.

## purgatory-fault-boundary-anchored-release

- kind: add | category: scheduler | origin: proposer | status: queued behind
  recovery-drain-point-sampler (judge gain 5, cost 2)
- title: Release a withheld message one fault-cycle boundary later instead
  of after a step budget drawn independently of the run's fault schedule
- Sharpest quantitative observation of the round and every number checks
  out: the delay draw is log-uniform over [5,300] with median ~39 steps
  (`exec.rs:70-77`), while a placed crash now sits a mean 427 steps past
  readiness - the delay budget and the fault schedule are drawn on
  incomparable scales, so cross-fault survival is a coincidence no
  delay_probability can arrange.
- Discounted for three things: the acceptance-distance observable is not
  exported in the eval record and its predicted direction is probably
  backwards (the bucket indexes the receiver's handler entries since its own
  restart, so releasing at a recovery pushes deliveries NEAR, not far); the
  "run still has an uncompleted fault event" guard needs plan knowledge that
  `exec.rs` does not have and no owner is named; and it attacks the same
  pre-fault-traffic-survives-the-fault hazard as the pool incumbent
  recovery-drain-point-sampler, which does it at cost 0.

## fault-frontier-client-reservation

- kind: add | category: config | origin: proposer | status: blocked
  (judge gain 3, cost 0)
- title: Reserve client work after the whole fault frontier instead of after
  each fault independently, and prefer a state-mutating request
- The mechanism critique is accurate line by line (`generator.rs:210-248`:
  per-recover iteration, uniform choice over all client requests so a read
  ~2/3 of the time, one edge each), and the targeting axis genuinely was
  never swept. But the argument rebuts the weakest counter-evidence and is
  silent on the strongest: `OBSERVATIONS.md:3052` records a zero ablation
  closing the family permanently - with post_fault_client_ops = 0 every rung
  moved inside the A/A band. If deleting all reservation edges is a null,
  the effect available to retargeting the same edges is bounded by noise.
  Its cited sweep line (5312) does not exist; the sweep is at 2769.
- Blocked until the write-up states, in one sentence, why the zero ablation
  does not bound this effect. Same precedent as cascade-fault-window-
  admission, rejected for proposing into a stratum the log had already
  characterised without answering the citation.
